Please read all of this comment before submitting an issue.

firebase-thermite was written because AngularFire2 did not suit my
requirements. It was published to serve as a resource for others who might find
themselves in my situation and also so that other AngularFire2 contributors
could see what I've done.

As such, support will be limited. Any bug reports would be greatly appreciated.
However, requests for documentation, examples or usage explanations will likely
be closed without comment, as, at the moment, I simply don't have the time for
that.

I will endeavour to answer any questions from AngularFire2 contributors that
pertain to this project's differences and why I did things a different way.
